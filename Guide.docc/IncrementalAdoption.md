# Incremental Adoption

Learn how you can introduce Swift concurrency features into your project
incrementally.

Migrating projects towards the Swift 6 language mode is usually done in stages.
In fact, many projects began the process before Swift 6 was even available.
You can continue to introduce concurrency features _gradually_,
addressing any problems that come up along the way.
This allows you to make incremental progress without disrupting the
entire project.

Swift includes a number of language features and standard library APIs to help
make incremental adoption easier.

## Wrapping Callback-Based Functions

APIs that accept and invoke a single function on completion are an extremely
common pattern in Swift.
It's possible to make a version of such a function that is usable directly from 
an asynchronous context.

```swift
func updateStyle(backgroundColor: ColorComponents, completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
    // ...
}
```

This is an example of a function that informs a client its work is complete
using a callback.
There is no way for a caller to determine when or on what thread the callback
will be invoked without consulting documentation.

You can wrap this function up into an asynchronous version using
_continuations_.

```swift
func updateStyle(backgroundColor: ColorComponents) async {
    await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
        updateStyle(backgroundColor: backgroundColor) {
            // ... do some work here ...

            continuation.resume()
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: You have to take care to _resume_ the continuation _exactly once_.
> If you miss invoking it, the calling task will remain suspended indefinitely.
> On the other hand, resuming a checked continuation more than once will cause an expected crash,
> protecting you from undefined behavior.

With an asynchronous version, there is no longer any ambiguity.
After the function has completed, execution will always resume in the same
context it was started in.

```swift
await updateStyle(backgroundColor: color)
// style has been updated
```

The `withCheckedContinuation` function is one of a [suite of standard library
APIs][continuation-apis] that exist to make interfacing non-async and async code possible.

> Note: Introducing asynchronous code into a project can surface data isolation
checking violations. To understand and address these, see [Crossing Isolation Boundaries][]

## Dynamic Isolation

Expressing the isolation of your program statically, using annotations and
other language constructs, is both powerful and concise.
But it can be difficult to introduce static isolation without updating
all dependencies simultaneously.

Dynamic isolation provides runtime mechanisms you can use as a fallback for
describing data isolation.
It can be an essential tool for interfacing a Swift 6 component
with another that has not yet been updated,
even if these components are within the _same_ module.

### Internal-Only Isolation

Suppose you have determined that a reference type within your project can be
best described with `MainActor` static isolation.

```swift
@MainActor
class WindowStyler {
    private var backgroundColor: ColorComponents

    func applyStyle() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

This `MainActor` isolation may be _logically_ correct.
But if this type is used in other unmigrated locations,
adding static isolation here could require many additional changes.
An alternative is to use dynamic isolation to help control the scope.

```swift
class WindowStyler {
    @MainActor
    private var backgroundColor: ColorComponents

    func applyStyle() {
        MainActor.assumeIsolated {
            // use and interact with other `MainActor` state
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the isolation has been internalized into the class.
This keeps any changes localized to the type, allowing you make
changes without affecting any clients of the type.

However, a major disadvantage of this technique is the type's true isolation
requirements remain invisible.
There is no way for clients to determine if or how they should change based on
this public API.
You should use this approach only as a temporary solution, and only when you
have exhausted other options.

### Usage-Only Isolation

If it is impractical to contain isolation exclusively within a type, you can
instead expand the isolation to cover only its API usage.

To do this, first apply static isolation to the type,
and then use dynamic isolation at any usage locations:

```swift
@MainActor
class WindowStyler {
    // ...
}

class UIStyler {
    @MainActor
    private let windowStyler: WindowStyler
    
    func applyStyle() {
        MainActor.assumeIsolated {
            windowStyler.applyStyle()
        }
    }
}
```

Combining static and dynamic isolation can be a powerful tool to keep the
scope of changes gradual.

### Explicit MainActor Context

The `assumeIsolated` method is synchronous and exists to recover isolation
information from runtime back into the type-system by preventing execution
if the assumption was incorrect.
that would otherwise be invisible to the compiler.
The `MainActor` type also has a method you can use to manually switch
isolation in an asynchronous context.

```swift
// type that should be MainActor, but has not been updated yet
class PersonalTransportation {
}

await MainActor.run {
    // isolated to the MainActor here
    let transport = PersonalTransportation()
    
    // ...
}
```

Remember that static isolation allows the compiler to both verify and automate
the process of switching isolation as needed.
Even when used in combination with static isolation, it can be difficult
to determine when `MainActor.run` is truly necessary.
While `MainActor.run` can be useful during migration,
it should not be used as a substitute for expressing the isolation
requirements of your system statically.
The ultimate goal should still be to apply `@MainActor`
to `PersonalTransportation`.

## Missing Annotations

Dynamic isolation gives you tools to express isolation at runtime.
But you may also find you need to describe other concurrency properties
that are missing from unmigrated modules.

### Unmarked Sendable Closures

The sendability of a closure affects how the compiler infers isolation for its
body.
A callback closure that actually does cross isolation boundaries but is
_missing_ a `Sendable` annotation violates a critical invariant of the
concurrency system.

```swift
// definition within a pre-Swift 6 module
extension JPKJetPack {
    // Note the lack of a @Sendable annotation
    static func jetPackConfiguration(_ callback: @escaping () -> Void) {
        // Can potentially cross isolation domains
    }
}

@MainActor
class PersonalTransportation {
    func configure() {
        JPKJetPack.jetPackConfiguration {
            // MainActor isolation will be inferred here
            self.applyConfiguration()
        }
    }

    func applyConfiguration() {
    }
}
```

If `jetPackConfiguration` can invoke its closure in another isolation domain,
it must be marked `@Sendable`.
When an un-migrated module hasn't yet done this, it will result in incorrect
actor inference.
This code will compile without issue but crash at runtime.

To workaround this, you can manually annotate the closure with `@Sendable.`
This will prevent the compiler from inferring `MainActor` isolation.
Because the compiler now knows actor isolation could change,
it will require a task at the callsite and an await in the task.

```swift
@MainActor
class PersonalTransportation {
    func configure() {
        JPKJetPack.jetPackConfiguration { @Sendable in
            // Sendable closures do not infer actor isolation,
            // making this context non-isolated
            Task {
                await self.applyConfiguration()
            }
        }
    }

    func applyConfiguration() {
    }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

It's important to keep in mind that static isolation, being part of the type
system, affects your public API.
But you can migrate your own modules in a way that improves their APIs for
Swift 6 *without* breaking any existing clients.

Suppose the `WindowStyler` is public API.
You have determined that it really should be `MainActor`-isolated, but want to
ensure backwards compatibility for clients.

```swift
@preconcurrency @MainActor
public class WindowStyler {
    // ...
}
```

Using `@preconcurrency` this way marks the isolation as conditional on the
client module also having complete checking enabled.
This preserves source compatibility with clients that have not yet begun
adopting Swift 6.

## Dependencies

Often, you aren't in control of the modules you need to import as dependencies.
If these modules have not yet adopted Swift 6, you may find yourself with
errors that are difficult or impossible to resolve.

There are a number of different kinds of problems that result from using
unmigrated code.
The `@preconcurrency` annotation can help with many of these situations:

- [Non-Sendable types][]
- Mismatches in [protocol-conformance isolation][]

[Non-Sendable types]: commonproblems#Crossing-Isolation-Boundaries
[protocol-conformance isolation]: commonproblems#Crossing-Isolation-Boundaries

## C/Objective-C

You can expose Swift concurrency support for your C and Objective-C APIs
using annotations.
This is made possible by Clang's
[concurrency-specific annotations][clang-annotations]:

[clang-annotations]: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#customizing-swift-import

```
__attribute__((swift_attr(“@Sendable”)))
__attribute__((swift_attr(“@_nonSendable”)))
__attribute__((swift_attr("nonisolated")))
__attribute__((swift_attr("@UIActor")))

__attribute__((swift_async(none)))
__attribute__((swift_async(not_swift_private, COMPLETION_BLOCK_INDEX))
__attribute__((swift_async(swift_private, COMPLETION_BLOCK_INDEX)))
__attribute__((__swift_async_name__(NAME)))
__attribute__((swift_async_error(none)))
__attribute__((__swift_attr__("@_unavailableFromAsync(message: \"" msg "\")")))
```

When working with a project that can import Foundation, the following
annotation macros are available in `NSObjCRuntime.h`:

```
NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE
NS_SWIFT_NONSENDABLE
NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED
NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR

NS_SWIFT_DISABLE_ASYNC
NS_SWIFT_ASYNC(COMPLETION_BLOCK_INDEX)
NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT_ASYNC(COMPLETION_BLOCK_INDEX)
NS_SWIFT_ASYNC_NAME
NS_SWIFT_ASYNC_NOTHROW
NS_SWIFT_UNAVAILABLE_FROM_ASYNC(msg)
```
### Dealing with missing isolation annotations in Objective-C libraries

While the SDKs and other Objective-C libraries make progress in adopting Swift concurrency,
they will often go through the exercise of codifying contracts which were only explained in
documentation. For example, before Swift concurrency, APIs frequently had to document their
threading behavior with comments like "this will always be called on the main thread".

Swift concurrency enables us to turn these code comments, into compiler and runtime 
enforced isolation checks, that Swift will then verify when you adopt such APIs.

For example, the fictional `NSJetPack` protocol generally invokes all of its delegate methods
on the main thread, and therefore has now become MainActor-isolated. 

The library author can mark as MainActor isolated using the `NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR` attribute,
which is equivalent to annotating a type using `@MainActor` in Swift: 

```swift
NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR
@protocol NSJetPack // fictional protocol
  // ...
@end
```

Thanks to this, all member methods of this protocol inherit the `@MainActor` isolation, 
and for most methods this is correct. 

However, in this example, let us consider a method which was previously documented as follows:

```objc
NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR // SDK author annotated using MainActor in recent SDK audit
@protocol NSJetPack // fictional protocol
/* Return YES if this jetpack supports flying at really high altitude!
 
 JetPackKit invokes this method at a variety of times, and not always on the main thread. For example, ...
*/
@property(readonly) BOOL supportsHighAltitude;

@end
```

This method's isolation was accidentally inferred as `@MainActor`, because of the annotation on the enclosing type.
Although it has specifically documented a different threading strategy - it may or may not
be invoked on the main actor - annotating these semantics on the method was accidentally missed. 

This is an annotation problem in the fictional JetPackKit library. 
Specifically, it is missing a `nonisolated` annotation on the method,
which would inform Swift about the correct and expected execution semantics.

Swift code adopting this library may look like this:

```swift
@MainActor
final class MyJetPack: NSJetPack {
  override class var supportsHighAltitude: Bool { // runtime crash in Swift 6 mode
    true
  }
}
```

The above code will crash with a runtime check, which aims to ensure we are actually 
executing on the main actor as we're crossing from objective-c's non-swift-concurrency
land into Swift.

It is a Swift 6 feature to detect such issues automatically and crash at runtime 
when such expectations are violated. Leaving such issues un-diagnosed, could lead
to actual hard-to-detect data races, and undermine Swift 6's promise about data-race safety.

Such failure would include a similar backtrace to this:

```

As you can see, the runtime injected an executor check into the call, and the dispatch queue assertion (of it running on the MainActor), 
has failed. This prevents sneaky and hard to debug data-races.

The correct long-term solution to this issue is the library fixing the method's annotation, by marking it as `nonisolated`:

```objc
// Solution in the library providing the API:
@property(readonly) BOOL supportsHighAltitude NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED;
````

Until the library fixes its annotation issue, you are able to witness the method using a correctly `nonisolated` method, like this:

```swift
// Solution in adopting client code, wishing to run in Swift 6 mode:
@MainActor
final class MyJetPack: NSJetPack {
  // Correct
  override nonisolated class var readyForTakeoff: Bool {
    true
  }
}
```

This way Swift knows not to check for the not-correct assumption that the method requires main actor isolation.

## Dispatch

Some patterns which you may be used to from Dispatch or other concurrency libraries
may need to be re-shaped in order to fit the world of Swift's structured concurrency model. 

### Limiting concurrency using Task Groups

Sometimes you may find yourself with a large list of work to be processed.

While it is possible to just enqueue "all" those work items to a task group like this:

```swift
// WARNING: Potentially wasteful -- perhaps this creates thousands of tasks concurrently (?!)

let lotsOfWork: [Work] = ...
await withTaskGroup(of: Something.self) { group in
  for work in lotsOfWork {
    // WARNING: If this is thousands of items, we may end up creating a lot of tasks
    //  which won't get to be executed until much later, as we have a global limit on
    //  the amount of concurrently running tasks - depending on the core count of the system,
    //  and the default global executor's configuration.
    group.addTask {
      await work.work()
    }
  }

  for await result in group {
    process(result) // process the result somehow, depends on your needs
  }
}
```

If you suspect you may be dealing with hundreds or thousands of items, it may be wasteful to enqueue them all immediately.
Creating a task (in `addTask`) needs to allocate some memory for the task in order to suspend and execute,
while this amount of memory isn't too large, it can become significant if creating thousands of tasks which don't get to
execute immediately but are just waiting until the executor gets to run them.

When faced with such a situation, it may be beneficial to manually throttle the number of concurrently added tasks to the task group, as follows:

```swift
let lotsOfWork: [Work] = ... 
let maxConcurrentWorkTasks = min(lotsOfWork.count, 10)
assert(maxConcurrentWorkTasks > 0)

await withTaskGroup(of: Something.self) { group in
    var submittedWork = 0
    for _ in 0..<maxConcurrentWorkTasks {
        group.addTask { // or 'addTaskUnlessCancelled'
            await lotsOfWork[submittedWork].work() 
        }
        submittedWork += 1
    }
    
    for await result in group {
        process(result) // process the result somehow, depends on your needs
    
        // Every time we get a result back, check if there's more work we should submit and do so
        if submittedWork < lotsOfWork.count, 
           let remainingWorkItem = lotsOfWork[submittedWork] {
            group.addTask { // or 'addTaskUnlessCancelled'
                await remainingWorkItem.work() 
            }  
            submittedWork += 1
        }
    }
}
```

If the "work" task involves long-running synchronous code it may make sense to voluntarily suspend the task and allow other tasks to execute:

```swift
struct Work {
  let dependency: Dependency
  func work() async {
    await dependency.fetch()
    // execute part of long running synchronous code
    await Task.yield()  // explicitly insert a suspension point
    // continue long running synchronous execution
  }
}
```

Introducing an explicit suspension point helps Swift balance between making progress on this task, and letting other tasks in your program make progress on their work.
However, if this task has the highest-priority in the system, the executor immediately resumes execution of the same task.
Therefore an explicit suspension point isn’t necessarily a way to avoid resource starvation.
