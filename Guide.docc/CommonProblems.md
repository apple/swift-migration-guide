# Common Compiler Errors

Identify, understand, and address common problems you'll encounter while
working with Swift concurrency.

The data isolation guarantees made by the compiler affect all Swift code.
This means complete concurrency checking can surface latent issues,
even in Swift 5 code that doesn't use any concurrency language features
directly.
And, with the Swift 6 language mode is on, some of these potential issues
can become errors.

After enabling complete checking, many projects can contain a large
number of warnings and errors.
_Don't_ get overwhelmed!
Most of these can be tracked down to a much smaller set of root causes.
And these causes, frequently, are a result of common patterns which aren't 
just easy to fix, but can also very instructive in helping to understand
Swift's data isolation model.

## Unsafe Global and Static Variables

Global state, including static variables, are accessible from anywhere in a
program.
This visibility makes them particularly susceptible to concurrent access.
Before data-race safety, global variable patterns relied on programmers
carefully accessing global state in ways that avoided data-races
without any help from the compiler.

### Sendable Types

```swift
var islandsInTheSea = 42
```

Here, we have defined a global variable.
The global variable is both non-isolated _and_ mutable from any
isolation domain. Compiling the above code in Swift 6 mode
produces an error message:

```
1 | var islandsInTheSea = 42
  |              |- error: global variable 'islandsInTheSea' is not concurrency-safe because it is non-isolated global shared mutable state
  |              |- note: convert 'islandsInTheSea' to a 'let' constant to make the shared state immutable
  |              |- note: restrict 'islandsInTheSea' to the main actor if it will only be accessed from the main thread
  |              |- note: unsafely mark 'islandsInTheSea' as concurrency-safe if all accesses are protected by an external synchronization mechanism
2 |
```

Two functions with different isolation domains accessing this
variable risks a data race. In the following code, `printIslands()`
could be running on the main actor concurrently with a call to
`addIsland()` from another isolation domain:

```swift
@MainActor
func printIslands() {
    print("Islands in the sea of concurrency: ", islandsInTheSea)
}

func addIsland() {
    let island = Island()

    islandsInTheSea += 1

    addToMap(island)
}
```

One way to address the problem is by changing variable's isolation.

```swift
@MainActor
var islandsInTheSea = 42
```

The variable remains mutable, but has been isolated to a global actor.
All accesses can now only happen in one isolation domain, and the synchronous
access within `addIsland` would be invalid at compile time.

If the variable is meant to be constant and is never mutated,
a straight-forward solution is to express this to the compiler.
By changing the `var` to a `let`, the compiler can statically
disallow mutation, guaranteeing safe read-only access.

```swift
let islandsInTheSea = 42
```

If there is synchronization in place that protects this variable in a way that
is invisible to the compiler, you can disable all isolation checking for
`islandsInTheSea` using the `nonisolated(unsafe)` keyword:

```swift
/// This value is only ever accessed while holding `islandLock`.
nonisolated(unsafe) var islandsInTheSea = 42
```

Only use `nonisolated(unsafe)` when you are carefully guarding all access to
the variable with an external synchronization mechanism such as a lock or
dispatch queue.

### Non-Sendable Types

In the above examples, the variable is an `Int`,
a value type that is inherently `Sendable`.
Global _reference_ types present an additional challenge, because they
are typically not `Sendable`.

```swift
class Chicken {
    let name: String
    var currentHunger: HungerLevel

    static let prizedHen = Chicken()
}
```

The problem with this `static let` declaration is not related to the
mutability of the variable.
The issue is `Chicken` is a non-Sendable type, making its internal state
unsafe to share across isolation domains.

```swift
func feedPrizedHen() {
    Chicken.prizedHen.currentHunger = .wellFed
}

@MainActor
class ChickenValley {
    var flock: [Chicken]

    func compareHunger() -> Bool {
        flock.contains { $0.currentHunger > Chicken.prizedHen.currentHunger }
    }
}
```

Here, we see two functions that could access the internal state of the
`Chicken.prizedHen` concurrently.
The compiler only permits these kinds of cross-isolation accesses with
`Sendable` types.
One option is to isolate the variable to a single domain using a global actor.
But, it could also make sense to instead add a conformance to `Sendable`
directly.

## Protocol Conformance Isolation Mismatch

A protocol defines requirements that a conforming type must satisfy.
Swift ensures that clients of a protocol can interact with its methods and
properties in a way that respects data isolation.
To do this, both the protocol itself and its requirements must specify
static isolation.
This can result in isolation mismatches between a protocol's declaration and
conforming types.

There are many possible solutions to this class of problem, but they often
involve trade-offs.
Choosing an appropriate approach first requires understanding _why_ there is a
mismatch in the first place.

### Under-Specified Protocol

The most commonly-encountered form of this problem happens when a protocol
has no explicit isolation.
In this case, as with all other declarations, this implies _non-isolated_.
Non-isolated protocol requirements can be called from generic code in any
isolation domain. If the requirement is synchronous, it is invalid for
a conforming type's implementation to access actor-isolated state:

```swift
protocol Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple)
}

@MainActor
class Chicken: Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple) {
        // access main-actor-isolated state
    }
}
```

The above code produces the following error in Swift 6 mode:

```
 5 | @MainActor
 6 | class Chicken: Feedable {
 7 |     func eat(food: Pineapple) {
   |          |- error: main actor-isolated instance method 'eat(food:)' cannot be used to satisfy nonisolated protocol requirement
   |          `- note: add 'nonisolated' to 'eat(food:)' to make this instance method not isolated to the actor
 8 |         // access main-actor-isolated state
 9 |     }
```

It is possible that the protocol actually _should_ be isolated, but
just has not yet been updated for concurrency.
If conforming types are migrated to add correct isolation first, mismatches
will occur.

```swift
// This really only makes sense to use from MainActor types, but
// has not yet been updated to reflect that.
protocol Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple)
}

// A conforming type, which is now correctly isolated, has exposed 
// a mismatch.
@MainActor
class Chicken: Feedable {
}
```

#### Adding Isolation

If protocol requirements are always called from the main actor,
adding `@MainActor` is the best solution.

There are two ways to isolate a protocol requirement to the main actor:

```swift
// entire protocol
@MainActor
protocol Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple)
}

// per-requirement
protocol Feedable {
    @MainActor
    func eat(food: Pineapple)
}
```

Marking a protocol with a global actor attribute implies global actor isolation
on all protocol requirements and extension methods. The global actor is also
inferred on conforming types when the conformance is not declared in an
extension.

Per-requirement isolation has a narrower impact on actor isolation inference,
because inference only applies to the implementation of that requirement. It
does not impact the inferred isolation of protocol extensions or other methods
on the conforming type. This approach should be favored if it makes sense to
have conforming types that aren't necessarily also tied to the same global actor.

Either way, changing the isolation of a protocol can affect the isolation of
conforming types and it can impose restrictions on generic code using the
protocol in a generic requirement. You can stage in diagnostics caused by
adding global actor isolation on a protocol using `@preconcurrency`:

```swift
@preconcurrency @MainActor
protocol Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple)
}
```

#### Asynchronous Requirements

For methods that implement synchronous protocol requirements, either the
isolation of method must match the isolation of the requirement exactly,
or the method must be `nonisolated`, meaning it can be called from
any isolation domain without risk of data races. Making a requirement
asynchronous offers a lot more flexibility over the isolation in
conforming types.

```swift
protocol Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple) async
}
```

Because `async` methods guarantee isolation by switching to the corresponding
actor in the implementation, it's possible to satisfy a non-isolated `async`
protocol requirement with an isolated method:

```swift
@MainActor
class Chicken: Feedable {
    var isHungry: Bool = true
    func eat(food: Pineapple) {
        // implicit switch to the @MainActor before accessing main actor state

        isHungry.toggle()
    }
}
```

The above code is safe, because generic code must always call `eat(food:)`
asynchronously, allowing isolated implementations to switch actors before
accessing actor-isolated state.

However, this flexibility comes at a cost.
Changing a method to be asynchronous can have a significant impact at
every call site.
In addition to an async context, both the parameters and return values may
need to cross isolation boundaries.
Together, these could require significant structural changes to address.
This may still be the right solution, but the side-effects should be carefully
considered first, even if only a small number of types are involved.

#### Using Preconcurrency

Swift has a number of mechanisms to help you adopt concurrency incrementally
and interoperate with code that has not yet begun using concurrency at all.
These tools can be helpful both for code you do not own, as well as code you
do own, but cannot easily change.

```swift
@MainActor
class Chicken: Feedable {
    nonisolated func eat(food: Pineapple) {
        MainActor.assumeIsolated {
            // implementation body
        }
    }
}

// Improved ergonomics and safety with Swift 6's DynamicActorIsolation
@MainActor
class Chicken: @preconcurrency Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple) {
        // implementation body
    }
}
```

This technique involves two steps.
It first removes any static isolation that is causing the mismatch.
Then, it re-introduces the isolation dynamically, to allow useful
work within the function body.
This keeps the solution localized to the source of the compiler error.
It is also a great option for making isolation changes incrementally.

### Isolated Conforming Type

So far, the solutions presented assume that the cause of the isolation
mismatches are ultimately rooted in the protocol definition.
But, it could be that the protocol's static isolation is appropriate,
and the issue instead is only caused by the conforming type.

#### Non-Isolated

Even a completely non-isolated function can still be useful.

```swift
@MainActor
class Chicken: Feedable {
    nonisolated func eat(food: Pineapple) {
        // perhaps this implementation doesn't involve
        // other MainActor-isolated state
    }
}
```

The downside to such an implementation is that isolated state and
functions become unavailable.
This is definitely a major constraint, but could still be
appropriate, especially if it is used exclusively as a source of
instance-independent configuration.

#### Conformance by Proxy

It could be possible to use an intermediate type to help address static
isolation differences.
This can be particularly effective if the protocol requires inheritance by its conforming types.

```swift
class Animal {
}

protocol Feedable: Animal {
    func eat(food: Pineapple)
}

// actors cannot have class-based inheritance
actor Island: Feedable {
}
```

Introducing a new type to conform indirectly can make this situation work.
However, this solution will require some structural changes to `Island` that
could spill out code that depends on it as well.

```swift
struct LivingIsland: Feedable {
    func eat(food: Pineapple) {
    }
}
```

Here, a new type has been created that can satisfy the needed inheritance.
Incorporating will be easiest if the conformance is only used internally by
`Island`.
