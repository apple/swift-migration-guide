# Enabling The Swift 6 Language Mode

Guarantee your code is free of data races by enabling the Swift 6 language mode.

## Using the Swift compiler

To enable complete concurrency checking when running `swift` or `swiftc`
directly at the command line, pass `-swift-version 6`:

```
~ swift -swift-version 6 main.swift
```

## Using SwiftPM

### Command-line invocation

`-swift-version 6` can be passed in a Swift package manager command-line
invocation using the `-Xswiftc` flag:

```
~ swift build -Xswiftc -swift-version 6
~ swift test -Xswiftc -swift-version 6
```

### Package manifest

A `Package.swift` file that uses `swift-tools-version` of `6.0` will enable
the Swift 6 language mode for all targets.
You can still set the language mode for the package as a whole using the 
`swiftLanguageVersions` property of `Package`.
However, you can now also change the language mode as needed on a
per-target basis using the new `swiftLanguageVersion` build setting:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    products: [
        // ...
    ],
    targets: [
        // Uses the default tools language mode
        .target(
            name: "FullyMigrated",
        ),
        // Still requires 5
        .target(
            name: "NotQuiteReadyYet",
            swiftSettings: [
                .swiftLanguageVersion(.v5)
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

## Using Xcode

### Build Settings 

You can control the language mode for an Xcode project or target by setting
the "Swift Language Version" build setting to "6".

### XCConfig

You can also set the `SWIFT_VERSION` setting to `6` in an xcconfig file:

```
// In a Settings.xcconfig

SWIFT_VERSION = 6;
```
