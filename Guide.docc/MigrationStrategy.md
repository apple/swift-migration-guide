# Migration Strategy

Get started migrating your project to the Swift 6 language mode.

Enabling complete concurrency checking in a module can yield many data-race
safety issues reported by the compiler.
Hundreds, possibly even thousands of warnings are not uncommon.
When faced with a such a large number of problems,
especially if you are just beginning to learn about Swift's data isolation
model, this can feel insurmountable.

**Don't panic.**

Frequently, you'll find yourself making substantial progress with just a few
changes.
And as you do, your mental model of how the Swift concurrency system works
will develop just as rapidly.

> Important: This guidance should not be interpreted as a recommendation.
You should feel confident about using other approaches.

## Strategy

This document outlines a general strategy that could be a good starting point.
There is no one single approach that will work for all projects.

The approach has three key steps:

- Select a module
- Enable stricter checking with Swift 5
- Address warnings

This process will be inherently _iterative_.
Even a single change in one module can have a large impact on the state of the
project as a whole.

## Begin from the Outside

It can be easier to start with the outer-most root module in a project.
This, by definition, is not a dependency of any other module.
Changes here can only have local effects, making it possible to
keep work contained.

Your changes do not _need_ to be contained to the module, however.
Dependencies under your control that have [unsafe global state][Global] or
[trivially-`Sendable` types][Sendable] can be the root cause of many warnings
across your project.
These can often be the best things to focus on first.

[Sendable]: <doc:CommonProblems#Implicitly-Sendable-Types>

## Use the Swift 5 Language Mode

You could find it quite challenging to move a project from Swift 5 with no
checking directly to the Swift 6 language mode.
It is possible, instead, to incrementally enable more of the Swift 6 checking
mechanisms while remaining in Swift 5 mode.
This will surface issues only as warnings,
keeping your build and tests functional as you progress.

To start, enable a single upcoming concurrency feature.
This allows you to focus on one _specific type_ of problem at a time.

Proposal    | Description | Feature Flag 
:-----------|-------------|-------------
[SE-0401][] | Remove Actor Isolation Inference caused by Property Wrappers | `DisableOutwardActorInference`
[SE-0412][] | Strict concurrency for global variables | `GlobalConcurrency`
[SE-0418][] | Inferring `Sendable` for methods and key path literals | `InferSendableFromCaptures`

[SE-0401]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0401-remove-property-wrapper-isolation.md
[SE-0412]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0412-strict-concurrency-for-global-variables.md
[SE-0418]: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0418-inferring-sendable-for-methods.md

These can be enabled independently and in any order.

After you have addressed issues uncovered by upcoming feature flags,
the next step is to [enable complete checking][CompleteChecking] for the module.
This will turn on all of the compiler's remaining data isolation checks.

## Address Warnings

There is one guiding principle you should use as you investigate
warnings: **express what is true now**.
Resist the urge to refactor your code to address issues.

You will find it beneficial to minimize the amount of change necessary to
get to a warning-free state with complete concurrency checking.
After that is done, use any unsafe opt-outs you applied as an indication of
follow-on refactoring opportunities to introduce a safer isolation mechanism.

> Note: To learn more about addressing common problems, see <doc:CommonProblems>.

## Iteration

At first, you'll likely be employing techniques to disable or workaround
data isolation problems.
Once you feel like you've reached the stopping point for a higher-level module,
target one of its dependencies that has required a workaround.

You don't have to eliminate all warnings to move on.
Remember that sometimes very minor changes can have a significant impact.
You can always return to a module once one of its dependencies has been
updated.
