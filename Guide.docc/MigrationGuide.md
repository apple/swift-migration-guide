## Overview

Swift's concurrency system, introduced in [Swift 5.5](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.5-released/),
makes asynchronous and parallel code easier to write and understand.
With the Swift 6 language mode, the compiler can now also
guarantee that concurrent programs are data-race-free.
When this mode is enabled, the compiler safety checks that were
optional become required.

Adopting the Swift 6 language mode is entirely under your control,
on a per-target basis.
Targets that build with previous modes, as well as code that uses other
languages exposed to Swift, can all interoperate with
modules that have been migrated to Swift 6.

It is possible you have been incrementally adopting all concurrency features
as they were introduced.
Or, you may have been waiting for Swift 6 to begin using them.
Regardless of where your project is in this process, this guide exists to
provide concepts and practical help to ease the migration.

Here you will find articles and code examples that will:

- Explain the concepts used by Swift's data-race safety model.
- Help you enable strict concurrency checking with Swift 5 projects.
- Provide techniques for incremental adoption.
- Present strategies to resolve common problems.

> Important: The Swift 6 language mode is opt-in.
Existing projects will not switch to this mode without configuration changes.
